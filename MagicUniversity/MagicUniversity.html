<p><h1>Magic University</h1><br></center>
You're one of the few... thousands of lucky students to have had the tremendous honor of attending the prestigious 
Lunaria University to learn the ways of the mystic arts with your fellow sisters. As I'm sure you're aware of by now, 
your final year consists of a series of grueling field tests designed to make sure that when you leave here you'll be 
more than capable of functioning as a capable mage. With your third and final year right around the corner, it's time 
for your Pre-Trial assessment. When you graduate you'll fill out a similar one so that you can see just how much you 
grew during The Trials of your final year. <br>
<br>
Please fill out the form below and send it off to the Department of Trials by the end of the week. <br>
<br>
Sincerely, Dean of Trials <br><br><br><br>

Each of the subraces has a handful of characteristics that are typical for them. Naturally, these 
are by no means absolutes since every individual varies, but look at a majority of the individuals 
of the particular subrace and you'll tend to see common threads amongst most. Additionally, each has a 
type of magic or skill that comes more easily to them than most thanks to either their unique physiology or 
culture, thus eliminating the need to formally study that particular subject. These don't vary from one individual 
to the next and are instead shared between all members of each respective subrace. <br><br>

<div class="txt">
Nephilim live their lives burdened with excruciating responsibility. While their human mothers may push them 
to do what they want with their lives, the society as a whole expects the daughters of angels to be unwaveringly 
pious. When the Angels last walked this land they passed down extensive tomes of their history and knowledge to 
humanity in an attempt to earn their worship over any other race from The Other. Of course, mating with the human 
women who all but threw themselves at them certainly didn't hurt their cause. Their attempts were largely successful 
with large religions still devoted to them. Temples dedicated to the Angels are scattered all throughout the world, 
and their half-human descendants are seen by their followers as demigods. Each of the Angels, and thereby their 
descendants, falls into one of seven categories. While little is known about the personalities of Angels, we do

Cambion are the half-demon, half-human descendants of one of the seven Archdemons that knocked up tens of thousands

generations and generations, but it's still quite a strong feature, even more so if they're close with their kin who

<div class="txt">
Kitsune are fox spirits that originated in the Far East where foxes are worshiped like gods to this day. 
The ancient ones could freely slip from The Other to our realm at will even after The Veil was established. 
In their homeland they were shunned for their love of our world and ended up spending more and more time here 
where they were more than welcomed. Four incredibly charismatic Kitsune had vast harems which men and women 
alike traveled across the world to join, and each modern Kitsune can trace their heritage back to one of the 
four. Today's descendants aren't as naturally powerful as their ancestors, but they do retain some of their 
traits. The most notable are their ears, the usual presence of one or more fluffy tail, and their unwavering values. 
Each Kitsune values one thing above all else, either public adoration, romantic affection, physical intimacy, or carefree fun. 
These core values make it easy to distinguish which family one belongs to.

<b>Dracokin</b><br><img src="Pictures/Dracokin.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Dragons, beings of truly terrifying power even by the standards of The Other, were some of the most powerful entities to 
encounter humans in the early days. Many women were fascinated with the creatures despite their imposing figure for a 
myriad of reasons, not least of which was their astounding intelligence and wisdom. The tremendous beasts had never 
experienced such frailty in their homelands and returned the fascination of the meager creatures. While the dragons 
often saw their relationship with their adoring worshipers as that of protectors a handful grew quite attached to 
their most devoted humans. These few used a magic long lost to this world to take a smaller humanoid form, though 
still fairly imposing by human standards, in order to forge an even more intimate relationship with their humans. 
Thus the dracokin were born, each hailing back to one of those first dragons to grow a particular fondness for humans 
and inheriting their ancestor's personal definition of "treasure". To this day, Dracokin still tend to view themselves 
as the most powerful of the modern races, though they often have a soft spot for humans.

<div class="txt">
Witches are the only race besides humans themselves who didn't originate from a coupling with a being from The Other. 
instead, when the two realms came into contact with one another the ambient mana from the The Other and this land 
coalesced to form an entirely new kind of being. Each of the numerous Witches formed back then was born of mana itself, 
making them beings of tremendous magical aptitude by nature. Despite each of the subraces' similar origins, the different 
kinds of mana that exist in the world meant that different kinds of Witches were born, each with certain side effects of their unusual origin.

The Seraphim have a natural affinity for fire and swords. Of all the Nephilim they are the closest you'll find to natural born warriors. 
They do tend to be more than a little self-righteous and consider their word to be law and are more than willing, and capable, of 
enforcing that law. They usually respect differing views from other Seraphim, but disregard those of most others. Their raw strength, 
rigid values, and usually imposing physiques make them prime candidate for warrior queens.

prefer to use their bows to deliver potent doses of love potion from afar. Others may not be too fond of having their emotions 
toyed with, but if an arrow meets its mark these fragile nephilim should have little problem avoiding a physical conflict. 
Given their loving view of the world they make excellent matchmakers, with or without the involved parties' consent, and tend

Thrones have an affinity for lightning and spears. They believe that there is a divine law, greater than any laws of their country or even

feminine, both in appearance and mannerisms which often hides the true depth of their ferocity. They're not as quick to war as 
their 'fire and brimstone' sisters, but they will not hesitate to smite heathens who would dare defy the divine. As such, they make

is more important than any set of laws. Because of their natural attunement to the suffering of others and the drive to help

Eve. However, while most take it to be nothing more than a legend it's not like it's entirely unfounded. Powers are the walking 
embodiment of fertility. Their culture holds a deep rooted believe that it's the duty of each and every one of them to make sure 
that their race lives on, not through protection but through perpetuation. They often take multiple partners for the sake of 
diversifying their offspring or, for those with the other set of equipment, to let them knock up a number of partners at a time. 
It's not uncommon to find a Power with an entire harem of men and/or women. However, despite their typically rather "healthy" sex 
lives they often hold a firm belief that having sex for any reason other than breeding is wrong. Needless to say, they make 
perfect breeders, though they tend to make wonderful hucows as well!

The major drawback to this is that if they don't exercise daily and carefully watch what they eat, then they put on 
weight very fast and thus lose their sneaky efficiency. Because of this, they utterly resent the Gluttons who can 
eat whatever they please.

The Sloths are magical prodigies thanks to their deep, intimate connection with The Other. While they can't travel 
there physically, they experience vivid and addictive dreams of it, feeling every single thing they dream of with 
stunning clarity. While dreaming their bodies take on a fraction of the experiences of the dreams, leaving them 
with usually toned physiques despite rarely working their physical body. This connection further enhances their 
demonic features including their wings, tails, and extra lengthy horns. In addition, their closeness with their 
magical heritage leaves their bodies with additional, unusual features from odd colorations to extra horns. 
Unfortunately, spending so much time with their visions leaves them drained and physically exhausted when they wake. 
During the 8 hours (maximum) a day that they spend awake, they're quite sluggish, though they're quite knowledgeable 
from all they've learned and experienced in their dreams. They can't stand Envies, and perceive them as noisy drama 
queens, always fussing over nothing.

They don't have tremendous aptitude for most magics, but they are the only race that naturally excels at blood magic.

However, there's a reason why the university has a careful vetting process before teaching a student blood magic. 
It can do a lot of damage in the wrong hands. That's why most people stay the hell out of the way of an angry Wrath.

strong cases, so to avoid fighting amongst themselves both sides agreed to settle the dispute the best way they knew how. 
By opening a slew of strip clubs, brothels, glory holes, fetish resorts, etc.. Each year the two factions meet to compare... productivity. 
The victory doesn't hold any real weight outside of bragging rights, but a confirmation that you're the more seductive 
offspring of literal lust is reward in itself. Both kind of Lusts despise Greeds because the 'greedy sons of you-know-whats'

The Vex Clan and the Phia Clan are two sides of the same coin, both value wisdom first and foremost. 
Despite this general similarity the two clans tend to butt heads frequently, both clan believing their 
approach to wisdom to be the proper one. Vexes believe that opening someone's eyes is best done by 
demonstrating to them just how little they know. Most people agree that it sounds good on paper until 
they run across one of these mischievous beauties. Talking can only get you so far which is why they 
prefer to teach lessons with tricks and pranks over words. Few people are genuinely appreciative of their 
efforts, but the results are hard to deny. Stepping into your office only to be met with a clothes-incinerating 
fireball from an unseen source is not something soon forgotten. Due to the nature of their brand of wisdom, 
each member of the Vex clan, when they come of age, develops a mask to conceal their face. The masks are infused with 
their very own mana, so as they grow more mature their masks shift to reflect the similar shift within them. 
it's a tradition for this shift in the masks to make them smaller and more decorative as a sign that they're 
skilled enough to not need to conceal their identities, with most elders' masks being little more than an extravagant trinket.

to experience as much of it as they can. Some who come from particularly notable families have a large 
family home to return to between adventures to recount the tales to their kin before setting off again. 
Perhaps not the most book smart, they rarely settle down long enough to pursue a formal education though 
some recognize the value, not in the education itself, but the opportunity to meet and learn from countless 
others from all sorts of different races and backgrounds. It can be difficult to immediately identify if a

With two years of studies under your belt you've had enough time to take 10 classes. <br>
What classes did you take during your time here? 
<br>
<button id="Basic-Elementalism" class="outset" onclick="Classes(1, 'Basic-Elementalism', ['Advanced-Elementalism'])">
<b>Basic-Elementalism</b><br><img src="Pictures/Basic-Elementalism.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Learn to control the base elements of fire, earth, wind, and water. You'll be able to light small fires or make a small breeze, 
throw mild but effective blasts formed of the elements, and conjure lesser elemental beings of each of the elements for up to 
ten minutes at a time. 

</div>
</button>
<button disabled id="Advanced-Elementalism" class="outset" onclick="Classes(1, 'Advanced-Elementalism', [''])">
<b>Advanced-Elementalism</b><br>Requires: Basic-Elementalism<br><img src="Pictures/Advanced-Elementalism.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Choose to specialize in one of the four base elements. Through further mastery of that specific element you gain access 
to a stronger version of all the basic techniques along with an advancement of your chosen element. Fire grants plasma, 
wind grants lightning, water grants ice, and earth grants sand.

<button id="Illusionism" class="outset" onclick="Classes(1, 'Illusionism', ['Deceiving-the-deceiver']); ExtraSpecialEX(['Ethereal-Dildos'], 'Illusionism')">
<b>Illusionism</b><br><img src="Pictures/Illusionism.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Learn to harness magic to make your target experience illusions such as copies of yourself by understanding the fundamental 
ways your magic play tricks on a target's mind. They can't physically interact with the target, 
but I'm sure you can come up with a creative use. 
</div>

<b>Deceiving-the-deceiver</b><br>Requires: Illusionism<img src="Pictures/Deceiving-the-deceiver.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Further delve into how to manipulate your opponent's psyche. The course is incredibly difficult, 
but if you're able to understand the material then by the end you'll be able to cause total 
hallucinations capable of physically affecting multiple targets simultaneously while defending 
yourself from similar attacks. Only those of the strongest mental fortitude will be able to withstand you. 

</div>

<button id="The-Joys-of-Chronomancy" class="outset" onclick="Classes(0, 'The-Joys-of-Chronomancy', ['Playing-With-Time']); ClassesExtra('The-Joys-of-Chronomancy',['Delayed-Gratification'])">

<div class="txt">
Time manipulation can be a dangerous subject, so admittance to this course and the following is predicated on a 
strict evaluation of your mental health. While it's true that this course only teaches you the fundamentals of 
time magic, even limited knowledge can be exceedingly effective. Allows you to fast forward or rewind time on 
any object no bigger than the size of an apple. You can rewind the apple back to when it was a seed or forward 
until it's just a decayed puddle. You could theoretically eat the same apple for all time by rewinding the munched 
down core back to its full apple-y glory. Or until you die, at least.

<b>Playing-With-Time</b><br>Requires: The-Joys-of-Chronomancy<img src="Pictures/Playing-With-Time.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
With an even understanding of chronomancy you're able to move your own body forward and backward in time with great effort. Doing so will 
exhaust your mana reserves quickly, so use it wisely. You won't be able to travel back in time, but you can de-age your 
body or rewind it back to before life threatening wounds.

<div class="txt">
Where the illusionary line of spells teach you how to exploit the weakness of your opponent's mind, force magic teaches you to 
to harness the strengths of your own. You'll be able to push and pull things with brute magical force.

You're beyond the stages of simply moving things back and forth. This class teaches you how to harness 
gravitational forces themselves to crush your target, with varying degrees of success. The smaller the object, 
the lesser its will, and the greater your own, the easier it is to overpower it.

<div class="txt">
For those who want a more nuanced approach to their education, this course provides everything you need to know to make simple potions, 
traps, and enchantments. Beware, you may have to collect the ingredients yourself. 
These include: 
Healing, mana regeneration, and stamina recovery potions. Great for quicker recovery from training sessions and minor kerfulfies. 
Animal traps (including fishing), smoke traps, and all sorts of fun ways for trapping people in nets. 
Sigils that can be placed on a building to keep beasts of your choice away, placed on boxes or chests to keep people out, or on a grimoire 
or staff to make it into a conduit for your spell casting, making spells less draining. 

</div>

<b>Advanced-Potions</b><br>Requires: Alchemical-Principles<img src="Pictures/Advanced-Potions.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Choose to specialize in potions and advance the effectiveness of your basic ones as well as giving you access to new ones. 
The new potions include hair/eye color changing tonic, paralysis potion and cute, slow-acting poison and cure, 
love potion (more like temporary, intense infatuation), despair potion (provides a totally killer buzz), 
boom-boom potion (explodes when thrown), magic-disabling potions, forget-me-not potion (short term memory wipe), and a sleeping potion. 

</div>

<button disabled id="Trap-Life" class="outset" onclick="Classes(1, 'Trap-Life', [''])">
<b>Trap-Life</b><br>Requires: Alchemical-Principles<img src="Pictures/Trap-Life.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
Choosing to specialize in traps allow you to develop more intricate traps for both human and animals. 
These include : explode-y and knock-out gas bombs that can be hidden to the untrained eye. traps laid above an open pit, 
traps to snare larger animals like bears, poisoned darts (have to acquire the poison from somewhere, and mana-sapping traps.

<div class="txt">
Specializing in signs allows you to form more intricate warding, allowing you to stave off even humanoids. 
With enough research you could probably even learn how to keep a race from The Other away if you really tried. 
Can be used to set simple traps that cast a minor elemental spell when triggered. Much easier to avoid than a 
trap specialist's work, but can be effective against oblivious opponents. As a sigil master you'll be able to 
enchant one grimoire or staff of your choosing with a special binding sigil that will bind a piece of your soul to it. 
You can only have one conduit bound to you like this and it will last until the object itself is destroyed, but while 
wielding it your spells will be substantially more potent.

<button id="Teleportation-Theory" class="outset" onclick="Classes(1, 'Teleportation-Theory', ['Greater-Teleportation']); ExtraSpecialEX(['Tentacle-Party'], 'Teleportation-Theory')">

<div class="txt">
Teaches you the theoretical basis behind creating harmless, temporary holes in The Veil to teleport things from one place to another. 
By the end of the course you'll learn how to teleport objects up to the size of a volleyball to anywhere within your vision. 

</div>

<div class="txt">
Teaches you the art of creating larger portals to instantaneously travel from one place to another. You can move yourself to anywhere 
you can see or places you frequent enough to leave your unique mana signature, such as campus or your dorm room. 
Alternatively, these skills can be used to transport something roughly the same size as you.

<div class="txt">
With this class you learn about an aspect of air that even elementalists don't focus on. While an air elementalist conjures 
air in short bursts, either mild or powerful, here you'll learn how to manipulate the air that's already your own body or an 
object in order to levitate it. Okay, so the title of the class may be a little misleading, but you'll be able to hover a foot 
off the air and avoid earthquakes pretty easily! That is, of course, assuming the earthquake doesn't bring a building down on 
top of you... it's also twice as fast as walking and not physically exhausting, but it requires mental focus to stay afloat. 
If your concentration breaks then you'll fall. I bet you'll be glad you're only a foot of the ground then!

<div class="txt">
Okay, this is 'real" flight. It can drain your mana reserves pretty quickly if you fly at high speeds, but skilled mages 
can break the sound barrier with enough practice. Just be careful not to drain yourself mid-flight and plummet to the ground.

<div class="txt">
Ever want to turn iron into gold? Well now you can! With this class you'll learn how to turn one substance into something else, 
from turning water into wine to turning a cucumber into an octopus tentacle. Why would you want to do the latter? Oh, 
you know... spell ingredients? Anyway, any transfigured substance that isn't consumed, like drank or eaten or used in a spell, 
will revert to its normal form 1 hour after the spell is cast. Can't be cast living things (so you can't turn a tree into a rock, 
but you could pick the fruit from the tree and transfigure it. Also you could turn a rock into a tree temporarily, 
though the faux tree wouldn't actually be living). This spell is the reason that crystallized mana is used as a currency 
rather than precious metals. Since mana is technically 'living', even if it's not sentient, it can't be artificially produced. 

</div>
</button>
<button id="Familiar-Territory" class="outset" onclick="Classes(1, 'Familiar-Territory', ['Greater-Familiar']); ExtraSpecialEX(['Unfamiliar-Familiar'], 'Familiar-Territory')">
<b>Familiar-Territory</b><br><img src="Pictures/Familiar-Territory.PNG" width="200"><br>
<div class="txt">
You'll learn how to bind your soul to that if an animal. The animal can be up to the size of a cat or small dog. 
It will gain unique markings identifying it as a familiar to accompany the abilities it gains from its bond with you. 
These markings can be anything from glowing eyes, to unique coloring, bioluminescent patterns on its skin or fur, etc.. 
It will be faster and slightly stronger than normal others of its species, but it's intelligence will be that of an adolescent human. 
Not a great fighter, but a wonderful companion and good for spying or intelligence gathering. You'll have a psychic connection 
that allows you to communicate to some degree. lt will understand you and will be able to communicate its feelings empathetically 
along with simple head nods, but can't vocalize much more. lt will follow your orders to the best of its abilities and will be 
unwaveringly loyal unless you are incredibly cruel to it. If it does leave you or if it passes away, it will cause you considerably 
psychic pain and you'll be unable to bind another for six months. You can only have one at a time. 

</div>

<div class="txt">
You can now have a familiar up to the size of a large animal, like a tiger or a bear. The ritual will require you to physically 
overpower your would-be companion will submit to your will, even if it's been with you as a normal animal for a long time. 
Such a powerful binding will be much more difficult and leave you drained for a week after, but your new companion will be 
able and more than willing to protect you from most threats, as a greater familiar is the most powerful immediately after 
its binding ritual. Once you recover your familiar will be able to communicate telepathically with you in your first 
language and have an intelligence nearly on par with your own. The more you grow, the more your familiar will as well. 
Alternatively, you may bind a smaller animal with this and it will still gain even more strength and intelligence. 
Of course a house cat won't be as strong as a lioness, but it will be the most powerful house cat you'll ever meet 
and more than capable of holding its own against a wolf.

<b>Basic-Combat-Skills</b><br><img src="Pictures/Basic-Combat-Skills.PNG" width="200"><br>

<div class="txt">
Further your study of the art of archery with this class. Rather than simply shooting arrows as an alternative to 
magic or as a last resort, learn to use a bow and arrow the way they were meant to be. With magic. 
By learning to imbue the arrows with your own magic you can increase their piercing power and accuracy. 
Additionally, you'll learn how to properly lace them with poison or imbue them with an elemental effect 
via sigils if you're proficient in either. 

</div>

<div class="txt">
If archery isn't for you, perhaps you'd prefer close combat. At the beginning of this class you'll choose a 
form of swordplay, from fencing to fighting with the larger, less refined claymore. Regardless of which 
blade you prefer you'll become a master with it by the time you finish the course. As with Sharpshooting, 
you'll learn to use your own magic to enhance your blade with extra force, slicing or piercing power, 
or minor elemental effects.

<div class="txt">
Similarly to Advanced Swordplay, with this class you'll have your choice of lethal weapons to specialize in depending on 
what tickles your fancy. However, the real kicker is the unparalleled training in being sneaky and incapacitating targets 
in a jiffy. Many may see your methods as cowardly but who cares? You can always just kill them. Right?

<div class="txt">
Swords break, arrows can be expensive, and mana pools run dry, but one's fists never give out. Unless your bones break... 
Fortunately with this class you'll not only learn the art of unarmed combat, but also how to inscribe sigils onto 
your hands and feet to both increase the force of your strikes while protecting you from the potentially harmful results of such force.

It's time to move on from simply invading someone's mind to explicitly controlling it. The ability to pull off the magic will 
depend on a number of factors including your own magical strength versus the target's own, their training in psychic defenses, etc.. However, 
if you're able to succeed in hypnotizing a person you'll be able to control a person's actions for up to five minutes at a time, 
more than enough to turn the tide in a small conflict. You can't make a person cause physical ham to themselves but aside from 
that you're free to do as you wish. However, it will take a lot of concentration to maintain the spell, so physically defending 
yourself or casting other spells will be difficult so make sure you're safe while holding hypnosis.

The course recently introduced for our more creatively inclined students, here you'll learn to channel that 
creative energy into something practical in the field. By infusing your paints, inks, charcoal, etc. with magic you'll be 
able to bring your creations to life. While their lifespans will be fairly short, ranging from half an hour to a day 
depending on intricacy and intensity of magic you pump into them, they'll be able to carry out various tasks. 
Create a sentry to watch over your room while you're in class or a beautifully crafted warrior to aide you in 
battle which will return to a mundane piece of art when their magic is expended so you'll never lose your creations.

We're not stupid. We know you're a college student and you're going to behave like one. That being said, we don't want your "extracurricular activities" 
to interfere with your studies. That's why we offer this crucial course in which you'll learn to strengthen your mind to counter-effect the 
harmful effects of alcohol. By the end of the course you'll no longer have to worry about forgetting things while drunk, poor judgment (worse than usual),

For those of you more interested in the path of the drunken magi you can continue to study one of the oldest known magics. 
In continuing your studies you'll learn to actually thrive while drunk, increasing your magical strength by drinking specially 
prepared alcohol. lt's not a costless strength increase, however. You'll have to let the infused bottle sit for a week after 
draining a large amount of your mana into it, but during that time the natural properties of the alcohol will dramatically 
increase the main that was pumped into it so that when you drink enough of it the potency of your magic will be amplified substantially. 
As a bonus, since you'll likely be pretty drunk pretty often, you'll learn how to add a minor healing charm to the bottle so that there 
won't be any long term negative effects of the consumption.

Smoke magic has long been considered the magic of the elite upper class thanks to its reputation for being little more than a 
luxurious novelty. However, the breed of smoke magic taught here is an entirely different monster. Instead of the simple parlor 
trick of the aristocrats you'll learn how to absorb the ambient mana from the air through a specially designed pipe that will 
vaporize it and allow you to blow it out for various effect. At this point your ability to control the smoke will be limited to 
a small cloud, but even that can carry anything from a concealed lightning storm to a transfiguration spell that will cast upon contact. 
The limits are only what magics you've studied thus far that produce a physical effect. Don't underestimate the effect of the ability to 
cast a spell subtly and without having to rely solely on your own mana reserves.

Having honed your skill at using your pipe you'll be able to create a substantially larger puff of smoke, up to the size of a cantaloupe. 
Additionally, instead of just casting your spells through the mana vapors you'll learn to replicate the effects of any potion currently in 
your system that will have a similar, though slightly lessened effect on anyone your smoke comes in contact with. Most potions are quickly 
metabolized though, so it's best to have one on hand if you wish to perform this act. Fortunately with more practice you'll be able to better 
control the smoke once it's been exhaled to ensure it finds its target.

Similar to smoke magic, bubble magic is often seen as a novelty, though this time more so because of its popularity with magically 
inclined children rather than the wealthy. Despite the stigma surrounding it. here you'll learn to harness the full potential of 
the unusual magic. This magic will use a pipe similar to that used by smoke mages, though it differs in function. Rather than inhaling 
the mana around you, you'll blow your own through the specially designed pipe to form colorful, lightweight orbs. However, unlike the harmless, 
novel counterparts produced by children, when these ones pop they do so violently. While each individual bubble may not have a lot of force behind it, 
a couple dozen impacting the target at once is sure to get their attention.

They can be used for anything from menial chores to scouting to retrieving ingredients. Unlike familiars their intelligence and knowledge 
is independent of your own, so they don't grow smarter with you but they do know much about light magic thanks to their bond to it and they

Some are happy to be of help, some like to play tricks. Some fly, some teleport, and some swim. In this class you'll learn about
 all different types. Their habitats, likes, dislikes, social customs. summoning rituals for each type, what they might expect as 
 payment, what happens if you don't follow through, how to convince one to permanently act as your familiar. They're strong magical 
 creatures and highly intelligent and make for great familiars but they will only do so if you're able to prove it's in the individual 
 fairy's personal interest. You'll have to end up giving her what she wants which usually means a lengthy task, or series of tasks, 
 some of which may take years to complete. Otherwise you can simply summon a small number of them for a short time to help with something. 
 Their small stature and high intellect and knowledge of magical things makes them particularly useful, but they will expect some sort of payment.

both of which are hardly mistakable so be careful. Maybe wear sunglasses or something while casting it up close. The anger that most people feel when they

You specialization largely determine your fighting style and/or the way you use your magic both by deepening your understanding of knowledge you've studied pertaining to it as well as building upon that knowledge to develop new magics that other students will be missing out on. While any specialization can go on to fill any role after graduation so long as they perform well in it, nine times out of ten a student will go on to work in their chosen field as a specialist in that form of magic.

Master of the traditional elements in their purest, most destructive forms along with force magic. Able to harness all four of the

Master over your mind and others. Not much in a fist fight... or a staff fight. But why fight at all when you can make your enemies 
fight one another. Your psychic prowess approaches even that of those who trained you. Only those who know you're in their head or 
have world class mental defenses of their own will be able to withstand you. Not only can you create illusory images, but with your 
skills in magics of the mind you're able to create illusions that stay around and can act on their own even after you stop focusing 
on them. You can dispel them as you please.

These are few and far between, but those capable of bonding with multiple familiars tend to find that their scaly companions were what

With enough will, beastmasters are able to bind their souls with not only multiple beasts, but more mystical ones as well. Each of their 
familiars receives the attributes of greater familiars, but now these unique mages are able to bind to beasts with magic of their own, 
such as a drake, dire wolf, or even a goddamn unicornl

<div class="txt">
Not only are you adept at elemental magic and a skilled swordsman in your own right, but your mastery over both disciplines allows you 
to utilize them in tandem unlike any other mage. One of the most popular specializations, for good reason, you have excellent capabilities 
in both close and ranged combat. When the fight does come to close quarters you can summon a an elemental saber of fire, ice, stone, etc. 
depending on your elemental focus, thus largely eliminating the need to carry a physical sword.

By combining force magic and acutely honed marksman skills you're able to send an arrow flying much further than any of your peers. 
Depending on the specific way in which you harness the force magic when the arrow does make contact with its target the results can 
be between a small, relatively subtle (by magical standards) entry and exit point, or anything up to a moderate explosion large enough 
to create a hole in an average wall.

Bulwarksand Druids go together like Nekos and collars, they might not like that the connection is always drawn between them but nobody 
can deny that they just fit. Bulwarks, like Druids, focus on a deep connection to nature to achieve their goals and thrive in wooded areas. 
Very much a protective specialization, they wear armor and spend their studies learning to make use of nature magic to form defensive shields 
of magically reinforced wood, stalling enemies' advances with vines, etc.. When all else fails they can call on Nature itself for protection 
and/or guidance. The stronger a Bulwark's connection with nature the stronger the reaction to their plea for assistance will be, 
with the most renowned ones being nigh indestructible when surrounded by a natural environment.

Masters of mobility, blink mages can fill any number of roles excellently and thus make a valued addition to most any team. Able to create multiple rips in The Veil in a short span of time or create large portals to move groups of people at once. Can very much be an effective utility mage, providing transport for their group or getting an injured ally to safety in a hurry. However, Blink mages also have tremendous offensive potential, being able to attack from multiple directions in the blink of an eye.

Druids are what most think of when they hear the term "healer." By combining basic healing skills with a deep, intimate connection with nature they're able to achieve unparalleled medical feats. Whether it's using all that nature has to offer to restore a recently lost limb or calling upon ambient magic in the air around you and your allies to provide continuous. nigh effortless restoration of minor wounds and fatigues to those around you. Druids are great for a vast majority of your healing needs.

For those who aren't interested in being a complete heal slut the path of a Battle Healer is a viable alternative. Rather than using nature's bounty to heal their allies. Battle Healers utilize the energy generated by causing pain to their enemies to produce powerful healing effects for their allies. Their heals aren't quite as strong as a Druid's, but they're much more capable combatants as a trade off.

<div class="txt">
Light and dark or life and death are often seen as polar opposites. However, Necromancers recognize that they're simply two sides of the same coin. As such, their magic bridges the gap between life and death, light and dark as masters of both. That is to say they're able to drain the life force of their enemies and raise the bodies of fallen allies to do their bidding.

<div class="txt">
Blood magic is risky business. I mean, pretty much all magic is. Even basic transfiguration can end up turning yourself into a toad if you're not careful. But blood magic is a different beast entirely. There's a reason the Hemomancy course only teaches you how to manipulate the blood of others. There Is a certain stigma surrounding full blown Blood ',Ines. Less because of the magic itself and more because it takes a ballsy mother to use their own life force to fuel their magic instead of mana. That being said, if you manage not to kill yourself you will have immense potential.

Pretty much every race has their version of gods, immensely powerful beings from The Other who many believe deserve worship and reverence. These 'gods' are indeed powerful enough to grant a portion of their power to those who have proven themselves devout. These lucky few are monks.

Twisting probability magic with the sheer unpredictability of raw, untamed darkness results in a catastrophic paradox. From that paradox chaos magic is born. Many believe this to be the veryfirst kind of magic from which all others were derived. Where a Necromancer has mastery over life and death, a Chaos Mage has mastery over the being an unbeing of non-living things. Don't get too excited, basically just a fancy way of saying they can bolster their allies' magics and nullify their enemies', with the added utility of disintegration.

Mystics play an important role in major cities, though a large part of that is simply as a status symbol. While Monks use the power of the gods to fight, Mystics are the ones capable of communicating with them directly. Though, of course, The Veil prevents them from physical contact. Additionally, Mystics are highly sought after by everyday citizens due to their acute attunement with the spiritual world and those who have crossed over.

<div class="txt">
True Smoke Mages are experts of manipulating and vaporizing mana with the use of their pipe. Those who choose this path typically have a rather expensive pipe very much tailored to their own personal tastes and aesthetic since it's as much a part of their identity as a mage as a Sniper's bow or a Bulwark's armor. Producing smoke is as easy as breathing for them and they're able to produce enough smoke to fill a room if they decide to. They're also often found idly puffing on their pipe and producing an ambient cloud of smoke near them even when focusing on something else. This can be particularly helpful since, with the use of their telekinesis, a Smoke Mage can turn a harmless cloud into a powerful offensive or defensive tool at a moment's notice with effortless control of their smoke.

Bubble Mages usually doesn't seem like a particularly notable path at first glance, since it doesn't tend to add much raw offensive, defensive, or even supportive power on the surface. As such not many choose to travel this road, however those that do learn the true strength that a Bubble Mage to hold. They're one of the few specializations capable of surviving entirely in a unique environment; in this case, underwater. Well, technically they can manage in any liquid where they can form bubbles like a pool of acid or lava but in those cases breathing would be the last of their concerns. The process itself is complicated, but basically involves providing themselves with air in a very delicate way while expelling the magical-produced air already in their lungs via their bubble magic since breathing unfiltered unnatural air is usually not the brightest idea. Don't worry, the important takeaway is the ability to breathe underwater indefinitely.

<div class="txt">
Chronotanks, like bulwarks, don protective armor when going into combat but unlike their more nature-oriented counterparts their strength as a meat shield comes more from the temporal than natural. Once the specialization is chosen they undergo a ritual which infuses their very essence with chrono magic so that if they ever perish their bodies will be restored to the state they were in when the ritual was finished and they'll be returned to the sanctuary where it was performed. This, in effect, makes Chronotanks immortal. However, the more times they fall in combat the more fractured their memories of previous lives will become so dying is still best to avoid. In addition to the ritual, their deep connection to time helps their bodies remember experiences even if their minds don't, giving them great reflexes with attacks they've experienced before. As such, training with a variety of types of opponents proves extremely beneficial.

No armor. No shields. Just raw, brute endurance. The lives of Berserkers are far from a painless ones, and that's just how they like it. Similar to Chronotanks, they undergo their own ritual. However theirs infused their bodies with a powerful magic that fundamentally alter them. Once the ritual is completed, the more damage their bodies receive the physically stronger they become until they're able to recover. At the higher end of their bodies' limitations they cease to feel much pain at all, allowing them to fight their way through it to the bitter end. Of course, they have to get up close and personal to really be the most effective, so they thrive with allies who can break down their enemies' magically defenses to provide an opening for them. Additionally, as they train in their specialization they learn to use a number of less common weapons in the magical world such as axes, hammers, maces, etc.. Despite that training, it's not uncommon to find a Berserker who prefers to fight with her fists over anything else.

Communing with nature isn't for everyone, neither is really getting into the heat of battle. For those who don't fancy either of these more traditional healing specializations a new, relatively experimental specialization was formed only a few years ago by a handful of exceptional students and one of their professors. This new specialization was that of the Potionist. With a unique blend of alchemy and healing magics these unconventional healers can produce any number of helpful potions on the fly using bottles made of dissolvable glass for throwing if their allies aren't in a position to drink one in the midst of battle. That does require good aim though, wouldn't want to heal enemies after all. In addition to basic healing potions they can create disease dispelling potions, potions to clear mind altering effects, or even more utility oriented potions like those bolstering strength or magical power. Given the specialization's experimental nature there's a consistent flow of new innovations, though many lack proper testing to be safe so be careful if you decide to utilize the healing traps or shoot an arrow from a bow with a healing sigh inscribed on it.

Fighting isn't the only way to resolve conflicts. Sometimes a little suggestion and flirtation is all it takes. While we emphasize that this is not an endorsement of how you spend your weekends, it is recognized as a valid alternative strategy for mages who are well suited for a more sensual approach to their problems. While Psychics focus on using psychic magic to attack their enemies or otherwise disorient them, a Seductress prefers to enthrall her targets with a combination of suggestion and allure. They excel at finding out just what makes their target tick and using that to their advantage. The best of the best can even turn their enemies into their allies.

Prophets, like Mystics, rarely participate in actual combat. Instead, they fulfil the valuable role of peeking into the future or discovering events long past. Given that the future has yet to be set in stone the view that they can get of it is fuzzy at best, but that glimpse can be the difference between success and failure or life and death for countless others.

Okay, so hear me out. While everyone else is busy throwing spells and hitting people with flaming swords you could be constructing elaborate traps magically cloaked as cupcakes or producing shrinking potions rigged up to a tripwire... Okay, so it might not be the most glamorous specializations, but Alchemists are masters of preparation.

While this area can be used as an escape in an emergency, that's really a last resort in most cases since opening that "door" is quite taxing when they come out of it they emerge in the same spot they entered. The main use of this isolated slice of reality is its offensive capabilities. While someone had to willingly agree to enter with you, once there you'll be able to challenge them to a game. The exact nature and rules of the game must be agreed to by both parties, but once set in stone the game will be carried out with the loser being magically compelled to give over whatever they agreed to wager while being simultaneously drained of their mana, rendering them incapable of casting spells until they've had time to recover. It's a gamble, but with luck on your side if you can convince someone to agree to play a game with you it could prove quite profitable.

Well parts of that seem a little unprofessional for a university form, particularly given the explicit images, but oh well. You briefly consider taking the form right to the the Department of Trials before shrugging it off, determining that it's not a pressing matter. instead, you slip back into bed to get yourself off while thinking of... Oh.. oh god that's wrong, you fucking sexual deviant. <br><br>
By the time you're done with your 'me time' it's nearly night time. Fortunately you're not far from the Department of Trials, so dropping it off won't take too long. <br><br>
When you reach the office the sun has set. It's dark out, but there are lights that line the sidewalk from which you came and the lights in the building pierce the darkness. Upon entering you're met with a familiar face. The dean stands before you and greets you with a smile. <br><br>
"Oh there you are. I was beginning to wonder if you had blown off your Pre-Trial assessment. Unfortunately the office staff has already gone home for the day, but since I'm here anyway I'm sure I can get this sorted out for you. Why don't you follow me to my office and we'll put the finishing touches on this, then you can go back to whatever it was kept you busy all day." <br><br>
The woman leads you to the third floor of the building, down to the end of the hall, and to an unmarked door where a doorknob is notably missing. She turns to you with a coy smile as she presses her palm to the center of the door. With a bright flash of blue light the door evaporates to reveal blinding illumination. You cover your eyes and within moments you feel yourself swept off your feet and an unmistakable falling feeling that makes your stomach sink. <br><br>
After a long few moments of free falling you finally dare to open your eyes where you're met with the sight of your own dorm room. it feels like a weird dream at first, but as you sit up in your bed and look out your window you notice something is distinctly... off. You could have sworn the sky wasn't purple before. And some of your peers might not be "normal", per say, but they certainly didn't look like that. And dear god, are those people fucking on the sidewalk! <br><br>
"Oh, l see you're awake." <br><br>
Before you sits a succubus. Not a half-breed like you're used to. A full-blown demon. Be thankful she's of the lusty variety. <br><br>
"Sorry about the theatrics, but !figured you may have a hard time following me in my true form. Not many mortals can withstand such sexiness." <br><br>
Her tail flickers back and forth at her own self-praise. <br><br>
"You have a lot of potential, kiddo. I want to help you develop it here so that when you return to your home everyone will see just how great you are. And, naturally, when you return I'm sure you'll be more than eager to let everyone know who helped you become such a slut-tastic piece of ass... What? Where's 'here'? Do they teach you nothing in school?" <br><br>

This is a personal favorite! You get to conjure a pit of wiggling tentacles from the floor that lasts indefinitely. It can't think and operates on the simple goal of capturing anyone, including the caster, that it can get its, well, tentacles on and fucking any holes it can manage to find. It will eventually tire itself out and let its captives go free, but it will take a while.

That's right! Become a world class scumbag. This little bit of magic allows you to form unbreakable magical contracts with others. There are a few limitation to what these contracts can entail.

Third, whatever the other party agrees to must be something they are actually able to do.

Smoke magic is great. Not as great as cum magic, but great nonetheless. If you insist upon using smoke magic this will dial it up a notch. Ordinarily smoke magic is limited to potion effects or physical ones like the elements, force, darkness, etc.. This will let you infuse your smoke with psychic effects as well. if you're already proficient enough in the discipline to gas up a whole room you could potentially put everyone in it into a hypnotic stupor or otherwise induce hallucinations. Considering smoke's ability to sneak into tiny spaces this can be quite useful for the particularly crafty.

Not dying is generally a pretty good thing. Especially for you since I have a use for you. That being said, being sexy is comparably important. Why compromise fashion for function? For that matter, why let your allies walk around looking non-slutty either!? This spell will turn whatever armor or clothes it's cast upon into an incredibly revealing alternative without losing its defensive capabilities. It may look like an arrow could easily hit your exposed chest, but rest assured it'll be protected by a magical force equivalent in strength to whatever armor you may be wearing. It will let other flesh through though so as not to interrupt casual gropes. Just try not to get punched in the tit... you know what, that's probably good advice if you take this spell or not

It can only be cast while in the middle of the no pants dance, but it will make sure that the target is 110% satisfied when it's over. It's great if you fall in love with someone who just isn't all that great, but also a lot of fun if you're playing the wing-man for your awkward, inexperienced friend.

Just a fair warning, summoning a demon is nothing like summoning a fairy. if you don't have the particular form of payment that the specific demon you summon wants then they'll take it out on your body and trust me, even with a Lust it's exhausting. Oh, and there's no way to know what demon you'll summon or what they'll want so good luck with that! That being said, once payment is given (upfront of course) you'll have a pretty powerful being who may or may not help you until they get bored. it's kind of a crapshoot, but if you get lucky you might make a powerful ally after a few tries! if she really likes you she might even give you a way to summon her specifically. She'll still expect payment though, just FYI.

Snow is cold as shit! Honestly, how can anyone tolerate that frigid, powdery virgin nose candy!? It gets everywhere and then you go inside and it melts and makes you cold and you might think fucking it it would be fun because, you know, it's white like some other fun, wet stuff, but no As nice as the hard tits are, the notable anti-hardness effect it has on a certain other part of your partner's body is the opposite of nice.

Aphrodisiacs are a little different in The Other. Here they're formed from infusing certain foods or other objects with little bundles of emotion magic. Rare and powerful stuff. Emotion magic can induce anything from rage to sorrow to lust and everything in between. However, it's not something that can simply be accessed by channeling your mana in a particular way. The only way to use it is to harvest special red mana that forms when two (you know, or more) people are truly in love. l know, I know but I don't make the rules. Anyway, I happen to have a little bit on hand. Don't ask how I got it. I'll help you infuse it into your bow so that every arrow you fire will channel that power. Be careful though.

This bit is a little tricky. Portals are inherently unstable. They will always close. It may take seconds, minutes, sometimes hours if you're strong enough, but they always close. However, I can show you a bit of technology I personally developed to get between my home and my... you know, nevermind why I made it. The point is I can show you how to set up permanent portals. The tech you'll use is roughly the size of an average door frame so you can't transport things much larger than that, but it's a helpful little bit of magic. And it teleports any clothes that cross through it into another, smaller portal which you can setup anywhere. It's great for hosting a party and setting the entrance and exit up back to back at the front door to make sure everyone shows up nude! Just be careful, some people may not appreciate their clothes being destroyed.

What's worse than getting to the very edge of a splendid release, only to find yourself stabbed in the heart (quite literally) and left bleeding out on the floor? The correct answer is "nothing." Lucky for you being the master or, more accurately, the mistress of life and death this isn't anything you'll have to worry about again.

Yes, that means occasionally taking on any who oppose her, but most of all providing countless orgasms throughout the land in her name.

This one is tricky. It will require a long, difficult ritual designed to break the cycle of death and rebirth that your previous one formed and refresh it with a much better one. For the ritual itself you'll be take to a location outside of time, bound and temporarily stripped of your magical abilities, and forced to engage a few demon sisters (the real deal, not the halfbreeds you're most familiar with) in a display of your sexual prowess until all four are satisfied. Trust me, their sex drives are nigh insatiable. You'll have no means of escape before it's done and it may very well take an eternity, but once completed you'll return here with no time having passed in this world at all. From that point forward if you ever die you'll return to the little space outside of time for another round of "play time" with the horned up demons before being returned to the immediate time and place where you fell with one of the sisters, whichever likes you the most, at your side until the immediate threat is gone.

It's a much better fate, don't you think?

Why should you be restricted to one person and a small isolated room when you can create a "game" anywhere with as many people as will agree to the terms? You can still create a pocket dimension if you want, now up to roughly the size of a fairly comfortable home that looks however you want, but you don't have to. It'd be a good way to get a good nights rest for your group if need be. Neat, right? Cool, I thought so to. Just as a side note, every game you play from now on will have some sexual element whether or not it's in the agreed upon terms. If it's in the terms then you can specify it however you want, but if not then it will be random. I mean, technically it'll be up to the goddess of luck, but it'll appear random to you. Don't ask how she knows when you're playing a game, even something as simple as poker or tag. And, ya' know, don't try to get by on what's technically considered a game because she most certainly doesn't care.

And now for my favorite parti I need you to be as lewd as possible. In fact, t need the world to be, so if you're willing to &kneeler-my-amusement-accept some curses to help ensure that perversion ensues then I'd really appreciate it... What? My appreciation isn't enough? Fine- I'll add 1 extra page to your grimoire for each curse you take. You can use these extra pages for either lewd spells or to Jill in for some classes you chose to skip out on during your studies. Personally I prefer the former, but it's up to you. Also, for all you Cursed Mages out there, don't think you can accept these and just undo them yourself later. Try it and I swear on everything lewd and perverse that I will hunt you to the ends of The Other! Oh and as a side note, avoid picking ones that would contradict one another.

Each time someone makes you orgasm, that person is able to tap into a portion of your mental powers. For the next twelve hours that person will maintain control over your arousal, both physical and mental, and your ability to orgasm. Unfortunately they can't lengthen this control by forcing you to orgasm endlessly, since the punishment has a thirteen hour cooldown which begins as soon as they gain control. 
<br><br>Be careful though, a clever person may just edge you for the twelve hours, wait one, then force you to cum again. It can be a tricky to break the cycle if you stumble across someone who wants to keep you stuck in it.
