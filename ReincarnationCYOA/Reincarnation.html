<b><h1>Reincarnation CYOA</h1><br>by Leander<br></b>
You can find the Original CYOA on imgur <a href="https://imgur.com/account/favorites/APFP1">here</a>
<p>Congratulations, you did it, you won the death lottery! Rather then having a body and a world 
assigned to you and having your memories wiped like most people who die you get to chose where and 
what you reincarnate as, isn't it exciting?</p>
<p>What you've never heard of this? Well it is a very low chance after all, and totaly not a way 
for me to cover up the fact I ran you over at 3am while on a drunken bende on earth, and now have to 
do this for you or get fired. Trust me, it's not easy to find a job as an angel nowadays so I need 
to keep what I have.</p>
<p>Anyway, try not to think about it too much and fill the forn in. Let me know when you're done 
and I'll send you off on your new life! Oh and one more thing, you have to reincarnate as a girl, 
as for why...Dont ask me, I don't make the rules.</p>
<p>Equipment - pick one<br>
Might as well get this out of the way first, it's exactly what it sounds like.<br>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Vagina" onclick="Click(0, 'Vagina', ['DickAndVagina','Dick'], 2)">
<img src="Pictures/Vagina.jpg" width="200"><br>
A vagina<br>
Exactly what it sounds like, normal female equipement. 
Not much else to say but have fun and be 
responsible with what you put in there.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="DickAndVagina" onclick="Click(0, 'DickAndVagina', ['Vagina','Dick'], 2)">
<img src="Pictures/DickAndVagina.jpg" width="200"><br>
A dick and a vagina<br>
Two for the price of one! Get the best of both worlds although 
it'll exclude you from wearing tight leg wear, unles you want the attention of course. 
Chose the size of your dick and if you have external balls or not.
</button>
<button style="border:outset;" id="Dick" onclick="Click(0, 'Dick', ['DickAndVagina','Vagina'], 2)">
<img src="Pictures/Dick.jpg" width="200"><br>
A dick<br>
Although this would technicaly make you not a female, it can still be done. It is a bit sad that 
you don't want to experience sex from the other side though... 
 Choose the size of your dick and 
if you have external balls or not.
</button>
</p>
<p>Body type - pick one<br>
Please choose carefuly! It'll be possible to change from one to the other trough hard work but change back 
to your regular lifestyle and you'll drift back to your choice here.<br>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Muscular" onclick="Click(0, 'Muscular', ['Fit','Skinny','Average','Curvy','ExtraThick','Plump'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/Muscular.PNG" width="200"><br>
Muscular<br>
You'll be incredably physicaly fit and gain muscle easily. No one will dare to mess with you 
like this and you'll be amazing at contact sports.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Fit" onclick="Click(0, 'Fit', ['Muscular','Skinny','Average','Curvy','ExtraThick','Plump'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/Fit.jpg" width="200"><br>
Fit<br>
A toned physique with hint of muscle definition and a nice tight ass. 
You'll be a natural runner like 
this and be good at most sports that require speed over strenght. 
 Losing any weight you might gain 
will be a breeze.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Skinny" onclick="Click(0, 'Skinny', ['Fit','Muscular','Average','Curvy','ExtraThick','Plump'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/Skinny.PNG" width="200"><br>
Skinny<br>
You'll be thin without much in the way of hips, butt or a feminine figure at all. 
Losing weight is extremely easy and unless you eat a lot of food you won't gain anything. 
You'll be fairly weak. Unless you take the boons to incrase your athletic ability,
easily overpowered by even average females let alone males, pick with caution unless you like 
 that kinda thing.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Average" onclick="Click(0, 'Average', ['Fit','Skinny','Muscular','Curvy','ExtraThick','Plump'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/Average.PNG" width="200"><br>
Average<br>
A perfectly average female body, you wont gain much weight but you won't lose it either. 
Appeal for everyone with hips that stick out a little bit and a nice sized ass.
</button>
</p>
<p>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Curvy" onclick="Click(0, 'Curvy', ['Fit','Skinny','Average','Muscular','ExtraThick','Plump'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/Curvy.PNG" width="200"><br>
Curvy<br>
A thick physique wih wide hips, an hourglass figure, a big ass and juicy thighs. You wouldn't be described as fat however, 
it's all in all the right places. Although you can gain weight fairly easily it'll just go to your assets rather then your 
stomach, and losing it to get back to your regular curvy figure will be a challenge but not impossible. Appeals to a lot of people.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="ExtraThick" onclick="Click(0, 'ExtraThick', ['Fit','Skinny','Average','Curvy','Muscular','Plump'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/ExtraThick.PNG" width="200"><br>
Extra Thick<br>
The more extreme end of curvy, a huge ass and very wide hips that sway with every step with a ridiculously over the top hourglass
 figure. You can gain weight easily but it'll go the the right places and it'll be a challenge to get your weight back down.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Plump" onclick="Click(0, 'Plump', ['Fit','Skinny','Average','Curvy','ExtraThick','Muscular'], 6)">
<img src="Pictures/Plump.PNG" width="200"><br>
Plump<br>
You'll have a full and huggable figure, however gaining weight will be extremely easy and loosing it again will be incredibly hard.
</button>
</p>
<p>Breasts - pick one<br>
One of the highlights of being famale, please choose carefuly!<br>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Flat" onclick="Click(0, 'Flat', ['Small','AverageB','Big','Huge'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Flat.PNG" width="200"><br>
Flat<br>
Are you sure? You'll have nothing to show off! I mean it does help with the cute factor if that's what you're going for and it does 
attract a certain type of person.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Small" onclick="Click(0, 'Small', ['Flat','AverageB','Big','Huge'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Small.jpg" width="200"><br>
Small<br>
Good for playing sports while still having a bust but you won't be using them to seduce anyone, unless they like small
 chests that is.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="AverageB" onclick="Click(0, 'AverageB', ['Small','Flat','Big','Huge'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/AverageB.PNG" width="200"><br>
Average<br>
To many people this is just right. Nice, warm and soft but won't stand out or draw much attention unless you wear revealing clothes.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Big" onclick="Click(0, 'Big', ['Small','AverageB','Flat','Huge'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Big.PNG" width="200"><br>
Big<br>
Nice and big, expect looks of envy or lust wherever you go unless you wear very thick clothes to hide them. If you want to 
move particularly fast or tackle stairs you'll need some very sturdy bras. If you lactate you'll be able to drink from the 
source with a bit of effort.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Huge" onclick="Click(0, 'Huge', ['Small','AverageB','Big','Flat'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Huge.PNG" width="200"><br>
Huge<br>
Not for the faint of heart, are you sure? You'll be unable to hide these under even the thickest winter coat and eyes 
will follow you everywhere. Don't worry about back pain or sagging though, my magic keeps that all in check. If you lactate 
you'll be able to drink straight from the source and you will snap cheaper bras on a regular basis.
</button>
</p>
<p>Height - pick one<br>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Tiny" onclick="Click(0, 'Tiny', ['Short','AverageH','Tall','HugeH'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Tiny.PNG" width="200"><br>
Tiny<br>
You're far, far shorter then even the typical short girl. Can work if you're going for a certain look but most people will only 
ever think of you as cute rather then sexy.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Short" onclick="Click(0, 'Short', ['Tiny','AverageH','Tall','HugeH'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Short.jpg" width="200"><br>
Short<br>
You'll still be shorter then average but still tall enough for most people to belive you are the age you claim to be. Expect to be 
looking up to most people and to need help getting things from high shelves. The generally accepted ideal heingt for short girls.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="AverageH" onclick="Click(0, 'AverageH', ['Short','Tiny','Tall','HugeH'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/AverageH.PNG" width="200"><br>
Average<br>
Average heingt for a girl, you'll be a bit shorter then most guys. Multipurpose, fits all the other body choices well.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Tall" onclick="Click(0, 'Tall', ['Short','AverageH','Tiny','HugeH'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/Tall.PNG" width="200"><br>
Tall<br>
You'll stand taller then almost all the girls you meet and be just a bit taller then the average male height, 
good if you plan on doing any sports in your new life and lots of people like taller girls. You'll have an aura of 
maturity because of your height and people will respect you more then if you were short.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="HugeH" onclick="Click(0, 'HugeH', ['Short','AverageH','Tall','Tiny'], 4)">
<img src="Pictures/HugeH.jpg" width="200"><br>
Huge<br>

everyone you meet and be asked to pass things from high places a lot.

<img src="Pictures/Succubus.PNG" width="200"><br>
Succubus +3 points<br>Lust aura, sex addict.<br>
A sexy lust demon, you can hide your demonic attributes at any point. I'm not supposed to allow you to chose this one, 
being an angel and all, but if succubus are as fun to be as they are to have in bed I just couldn't let you not have this option.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Kitsune" onclick="Click(3, 'Kitsune', ['Succubus','Human','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','SmoothTalker','LiquidLunch'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/Kitsune.jpg" width="200"><br>
Kitsune +3 points<br>Smooth talker, liquid lunch.<br>
Another sex demon and just as good in bed as a succubus, don't tell anyone I said that. Can have multiple long fluffy 
tails which are incredibly soft. Goon luck looking after all that fur if you chose to have a lot of tails and dont have 
the good hair day boon though.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Catgirl" onclick="Click(2, 'Catgirl', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Human','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','Flexible','Heat'], 16)">

<img src="Pictures/Harpy.jpg" width="200"><br>
Harpy +2 points<br>Flight, toxic waste.<br>
Girls with wings in place of arms, some may have a feathered tail and feathers in other places too but this is the 
basic trait shared by them all. As you can imagine not having arms makes even simple cooking completely beyond them. 
They usualy look younger then they actualy are with thin bodies but in this case your species has no bearing on your body type.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Cowgirl" onclick="Click(2, 'Cowgirl', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Human','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','EasyPregnancy','MilkFountain'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/Cowgirl.PNG" width="200"><br>
Cowgirl +2 points<br> Easy pregnancy, milk fountain.<br>
Typicaly with huge breasts and a plump figure, but in this case your species has no bearing on your body type.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="SlimeGirl" onclick="Click(2, 'SlimeGirl', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','Human','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','Stretchy','FullBodyStimulation'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/SlimeGirl.PNG" width="200"><br>
Slime girl +2 points<br>Stretchy, full body stimulation.<br>
These are extra fun! Slime girls entire bodies are made of slime(obviously) and they are very sensitive. Just try poking 
your finger into one's arm and watch them squirm from the pleasure.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Centaur" onclick="Click(2, 'Centaur', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Human','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','Athletic','Messy'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/Centaur.PNG" width="200"><br>
Centaur +2 points<br>Athletic, Messy.<br>
Centaurs have a horse body from the weist down and the genetals to match, if you have a dick I recomend making sure the one 
reciving it is nice and stretched out before you start. They are very fast runners thanks to their horse lower half.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Angel" onclick="Click(1, 'Angel', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Human','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','WWTLF','DivineJudgment'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/Angel.PNG" width="200"><br>
Angel +1 points<br>
Who wants to live forever? Divine judgment.  I really can't recomend it, being one myself and all the other options sound 
more interesting. But then again it is your choice after all, at least your wings are nice and sensitive, so if you get 
someone who knows how to give a good massage you'll have the time of your live. Bear in mind you will have wings but you won't 
be able to fly unless you have the the perk. You can hide your halo at will.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Fairy" onclick="Click(2, 'Fairy', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Human','Mermaid','PlantGirl','CYO','Apprentice','Quiet'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/Fairy.PNG" width="200"><br>
Fairy +2 points<br>Apprentice, quiet.<br>
Fairies are far smaller then regular humns, some have colorful butterfly wings while some don't. Other then being at 
maximum 30cm high they are still proportioned correctly so will work with any body type.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="Mermaid" onclick="Click(2, 'Mermaid', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Human','PlantGirl','CYO','WaterBreathing','Gullible'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/Mermaid.PNG" width="200"><br>
Mermaid +2 points<br>Water breathing, gulible.<br>
Mermaids can swim trough the water at incredible speeds but will need either magic or assistance to move around on land. 
Being a solitary species mainly, they are poor when it comes to social cues and can be a little too trusting.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="PlantGirl" onclick="Click(2, 'PlantGirl', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','Human','CYO','Tentacles','SuperFertile'], 16)">
<img src="Pictures/PlantGirl.PNG" width="200"><br>
Palnt girl +2 points<br>Tentacles, super fertile.<br>
As plant girls tend to live in isolated areas of the forest, they are incredibly fertile so if they do come across someone they 
can get pregnant easaly and have children. Although they have a human looking body and can walk around, this is deceptive as most 
of them lies in an immobile giant flower. Plant girls living in civilisation have had there flowers moved, usualy into big plant 
pots so it isn't too far away, as without it they would wither away after a while. They need to spend at least an hour a day 
inside the flower tp recharge their energy.
</button>
<button style="border: outset;" id="CYO" onclick="Click(1, 'CYO', ['Succubus','Kitsune','Catgirl','DogGirl','Lamia','Harpy','Cowgirl','SlimeGirl','Centaur','Angel','Fairy','Mermaid','PlantGirl','Human'], 14)">

memories of your life as a girl.

new life. Some might ba a little too supportive though.
</button>

<img src="Pictures/OITR.PNG" width="200"><br>
Out in the rain<br>
No one will recognise you in your new body and it will take a lot of convincing to make them belive you. 
For the most part this means people will think you are dead or missing until you prove otherwise. Useful if you want a new start.
</button>
</p>
<p>Boons and banes<br>Boons are advantages and useful skills you can use in your new life, each will cost a number of points and if you want more 
you'll have to take some banes to pay for them. Sorry, I'm not powerful enough to give you everything you want with no drawbacks!<br>

Quiet + 1 point<br>
Cannot be taken if you become a mute from speak no evil. You just can't bring yourself to talk loudly 
and shouting for you will just be normal talking to most people. You'll sound more submissivo and oxpect 
lots of people to tell you to speak up constantly. Cute if you can pull it off.

You just can't go to sloop without a dick inside you, or without yours inside someone else Don't worry if you're a lesbian though,

tight your pussy is or how big your dick is.

Inconceivable + 2 points<br>
Life is now somewhere between a porno and a comedic anime. you trip and land on a dude's face on a day you were going commando in a skirt. 
Get locked out of your apartment in nothing but a towel and have that get stolen by a dog. A girl accidentally sits on your lap on a 
crowded bus and decides to get herself oft on the erection she is surprised to discover. Going a day without being edged, teased, 
or groped is practically impossible.

Parasite + 2 points<br>
A parasite lives inside you. either in your womb, ass or somewhere less conventional like your dick or balls and it 
feeds off sexual fluids. It will constantly stimulate you to feed and will try to make you horny around others to 
try to get you to sleep with them. Every so often it will lay eggs that you can put into others to infest them as well. 
If it gets particularly large you will look pregnant. If you do actually get pregnant the parasite 
won't damage the baby in any way.

Interdimensional tentacle rape + 1 point<br>
Once every three weeks, tentacles will appear in your room at night and roughly fuck you for several hours then 
fill you with their young. It will feel absolutely amazing as they move around and a few days later they will be born.

Lapse in concentration + 1 point<br>
Unless you're being constantly stimulated you can't think straight. Something like a bullet vibe on a low setting 
will be enough to avoid the negative effects of this bane but you'll have to wear it constantly.

Divine Judgment + 1 point<br>
Any time you do something you know is bad, you will receive punishment equal to the severity of your crime. 
Eg: if you rape someone as a succubus because you haven't had sex in a long time and can control yourself 
you won't be punished, but if you do it while not starved you will be punished.

Fantasy - 1 point<br>
You are reincarnated into a world of swords and sorcery. Do whatever you like, go killing dragons or settle down with

non human species will be out of place.

It could be a galaxy spanning space opera or a dark dystopian cyberpunk future on an overcrowded earth. up to you. 
Aliens (If you chose one where humanity has gone into space beyond our solar system.) and/or genetic modification 
are commonplace so the different non-human species are not thought of as weird.
