<br>system for you. Some options will give you points, but most will cost points.

<br>
<b>You start with 30 Points</b>

This pet is particularly ravenous, <br>the both of you will need to orgasm <br>10 times each day.<br>
<br>
If you have a Swarm pet each body <br>will require 3 orgasms. <br>Remember each of your orgasms, <br>can feed multiple bodies at a time.

This pet has an intolerance for any <br>clothing that isn't sexy or revealing.<br>
<br>
If you wear any offending clothing, <br>you'll have only a few minutes to <br>remove it before your pet <br>does so for you.

You're probably already a <br>kinky pervert.<br>
But having sex with a corruptive <br>pet will really bring out your <br>inner freak.<br>
<br>
Your libido will increase, <br>your thoughts will be lewder <br>and you'll do kinkier things <br>with your pet.

There isn't anything wrong with <br>this one...it's just ugly.<br>
<br>
Maybe it has some creepy eyes, <br>mouths, or other unsettling features. <br>But apart from that theres nothing <br>wrong with it.

(Cannot take with <br>Marathon or Glutton)<br>
Yes, some tentacle pets have <br>refractory periods. They can only <br>cum 3 times a day, after that <br>any sex is uncomfortable and <br>should be avoided.<br>
The bodies of a swarm pet <br>can only handle 1 orgasm a day.

(Cannot take with Messy, <br>Fertile, Cum Production, <br>Nourishing or Tasty)<br>
This pet cannot produce any <br>cum at all. It can still orgasm, <br>but there wont be any fireworks.<br>
<br>
It can still produce <br>slime and eggs just fine.

<br>
(Invalidates Amphibious)<br>
This pet came from a line of <br>water-breathing tentacle monsters, <br>allowing it to survive underwater, <br>and provide oxygen to its mate.<br>
<br>
However its main body has to <br>remain in water or else it'll <br>shrivel up into a useless ball.

This pet stalks the night and <br>sleeps during the day. <br>Don't think cutting it off from <br>the outside will help, it has a <br>flawless internal clock.<br>
<br>
You'll have to feed it during <br>nighttime, otherwise it <br>might take you while <br>you're asleep.

For some reason, this pet can't <br>move itself. Something or <br>someone else will have to move it .<br>
<br>
Hopefully it isn't too <br>large and heavy to move around.

(Cannot take with Symbiote)<br>
One thing we pride ourselves on <br>is how much our pets love their <br>masters. But sometimes it's a <br>little too much.<br>
Being away from your pet for more <br>then an hour will cause it to <br>panic. and it will probably fuck <br>you when you get back to <br>calm itself down.

<br>
This pet is a little obsessive. It <br>will get upset if you have any <br>sexual relations with someone or <br>something else.<br>
<br>
That is unless, you and your partner <br>have frequent sex with your pet. <br>In that case it'll feel included <br>and won't get upset.

<br>
Some tentacle monsters bond for <br>life, only having a single mate.<br>
<br>
This one is rather nervous around <br>new people, and it needs to <br>know them for a while before <br>it'll have sex with them.<br>
<br>
Watching you fuck someone will <br>get it to trust them faster.

These two pets are inseperable! <br>If you want one you'll have to <br>take both.<br>
Both pets share the same body type, <br>but can otherwise have different <br>sizes and appearances.<br>
<br>
Any perks or drawbacks will <br>apply to both of them. <br>And you need to give them <br>equal attention.

This pet has a unique <br>digestive system. it can only <br>feed from somebodies orgasm <br>once a day.<br>
<br>
This means that for every <br>orgasm it requires, you'll need <br>an additional person for it to fuck.
