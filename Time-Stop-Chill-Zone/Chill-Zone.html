<div class="intro"><center>Intro:</center><br>
Anon, hey, listen; I've seen all the shit you've had to go through. It's not fair, and it's not right -- even if you feel like you deserve it, you don't. I'm gonna help you out. See, I'm tired of having to see a bunch of people like you dying the lifelong death of a thousand paper cuts, and I've decided to use my power to grant you (the first out of many, I imagine) your very own Time-&#xfeff;Stop&nbsp;Chill&nbsp;Zone, where you can spend as long as you want doing what you like, whether it be catching up on your backlog of games, working out for gains, or just cuddling all your stress away, over and over and over again untill you get sick of it and all your pain dies its own unfair death. I,m not super good at doing this yet, so you'll have to split some hairs for now, but I'll come back eventualy somewhere along the line to probably give you the rest.
</div>
</div>
<div class="division">
<div class="titleL">Freebies >>></div>
<div class="titleR">There are some things you just shouldn't have to pay for; consider these on the house. You can turn them on or off at any given time at your discretion. [Time has Stopped], for example, causes problems if people enter/leave the Zone with it on. </div>
<center>
<button class="unselect"><div>[Infinite Life]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Infinite-Life.PNG"><br>
<div>Surprisingly easy to grant, actually. With this, you and anyone else in the Zone can't die, can't feel undesired pain, won't age, and will feel healthy and fit. Diseases/injuries that heal on their own still do while in the Zone, too. 
</div></button>
<button class="unselect"><div>[Infinite Stamina]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Infinite-Stamina.PNG"><br>
<div>You don't tire out or get winded if you don't want to. If you do want to, you can make yourself tired (for example, to enhance cuddling). Applies to sexual stamina, as well. "Lasting forever" is no big deal. 
</div></button>
<button class="unselect"><div>[Forever Clean]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Forever-Clean.PNG"><br>
<div>All things cleanliness are automatic and swift in the Zone. Nothing gets dirty or smells bad. No one needs to use the restroom, and women don't experience their cycle while in the Zone. Dishes get cleaned and blankets fold themselves. 
</div></button>
<button class="unselect"><div>[Time has Stopped]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Time-Has-Stopped.PNG"><br>
<div>Time in the Zone will pass about 30,000,000 times more quickly than the outside, effectively freezing time. For every single year in the Zone, about 1 second outside will pass. Your tiny lunch break is now 18 centuries, if you like. 
</div></button>
<button class="unselect"><div>[Room Essentials]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Room-Essentials.PNG"><br>
<div>Any furniture or hookups necessary for a regular home, provided free of charge. Free water and electricity/gas, climate control, light fixtures, a bed, kitchenette with unlimited basic ingredients, etc. 
</div></button>
<button class="unselect"><div>[Existential Sentinel]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Existential-Sentinel.PNG"><br>
<div>Basically just a guard that won't do anything but make sure you stay sane by providing its existence and occasionally doing small favors for you in case you create a Zone where it's otherwise eerily empty. Not a "friend," but useful. 
</div></button>
</center>

<div class="titleL">Room type >>></div>
<div class="titleR">Go ahead and pick what your Zone looks like. This is mostly an aesthetic choice. You can have as big of or as many rooms as you like in whatever arrangement you like, but don't go overboard. It is a little taxing for me. You can also specify little details about the room that aren't covered, like if you'd like them to be connected by a particular kind of door. Go hog wild. 
</div>
<center>
<button id="Metal-Cubes" onclick="Item('Metal-Cubes', 0)" class="unselect"><div>[Metal Cubes]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Metal-Cubes.PNG"><br>
<div>Very otherworldly, but well-lit and surprisingly comfy. Its the same kind of feeling when you lay I pn some cold linoleum! on a hot summer day. It's comfy in its own way. High ceilings, too, and a great lack of visual stimuli to clear your mind. 
</div></button>
<button id="Log-Cabin" onclick="Item('Log-Cabin', 0)" class="unselect"><div>[Log Cabin]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Log-Cabin.PNG"><br>
<div>The classic. Plenty of varnished and polished wood everywhere, a nice fireplace, and the feeling that you're sort of one with nature (even if the logs are dead -- minor detail). Warm ochre lighting keeps moods happy and snuggly. 
</div></button>
<button id="Suburbia" onclick="Item('Suburbia', 0)" class="unselect"><div>[Suburbia]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Suburbia.PNG"><br>
<div>The classic bread-and-butter domicile of the average American childhood, with plastered walls and wall-to-wall carpets and/or linoleum (hardwood is for tryhards). Don't bang your head on the coffee table in your blanket fort. 
</div></button>
<button id="Ethnic-as-Fuck" onclick="Item('Ethnic-as-Fuck', 0)" class="unselect"><div>[Ethnic as Fuck]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Ethnic-as-Fuck.PNG"><br>
<div>Anything necessary to style your Zone like a foreign home. Adobe, paper doors, statues of a glorious dictator. Whatever you like, as long as it's necessary for the image. Any culture, real or fictional, is fine with me, as long as it's nothing OP. 
</div></button>
<button id="Virtual" onclick="Item('Virtual', 0)" class="unselect"><div>[Virtual]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Virtual.PNG"><br>
<div>Bright neon lights floating in the air or pulsing along the walls, glowing hexagons marking your footsteps, code and numbers flashing in the windows. It's all a world-wide-web. Let mankind's collective progress wash over you. 
</div></button>
<button id="Other-Room" onclick="Item('Other-Room', 0)" class="unselect"><div>[Other-Room]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Other.PNG"><br>
<div>Just the stock-standard catch-all. Here are a few suggestions. A moon-base or space-station. A prefabricated shipping-crate-home plopped in a forest. A house-boat or aircraft carrier. It's just whatever you want, man. 
</div></button>
</center>

<div class="titleL">Entrance Method >>></div>
<div class="titleR">Decide how you're going to enter/exit the Zone. Please note: Physical items are soulbound and unbreakable. People can eject themselves from the Zone at any time, reappearing where they were before entering, and you can close off your Zone to entry/eject others if need be. If there's somehow no physical room left in the Zone, the Zone auto-ejects everyone. 
</div>
<center>
<button id="Power-Gem" onclick="Click('Power-Gem', ['Epic-Pose','Touchy-Feely','Portable-Hole','Dial-Up','Other'])" class="unselect"><div>[Power Gem]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Power-Gem.PNG"><br>
<div>A gemstone set in a piece of jewelry or in a pendant that will teleport those of your choosing within a 5 meter radius (including yourself, of course) into the Zone in a brilliant flash of light. The stone is also very pretty and will glow at your will. 
</div></button>
<button id="Epic-Pose" onclick="Click('Epic-Pose', ['Power-Gem','Touchy-Feely','Portable-Hole','Dial-Up','Other'])" class="unselect"><div>[Epic Pose]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Epic-Pose.PNG"><br>
<div>Strike a pose or perform a physical action while saying a phrase and you'll he instantly teleported into the Zone. Anyone else can do this, too, but the Existential Sentinel will kick them out if they don't belong there. Keep the combo secret. 
</div></button>
<button id="Touchy-Feely" onclick="Click('Touchy-Feely', ['Power-Gem','Epic-Pose','Portable-Hole','Dial-Up','Other'])" class="unselect"><div>[Touchy-Feely]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Touchy-Feely.PNG"><br>
<div>You can just teleport yourself instantly if you want, but if anyone else wants to come with you, they have to be giving you a hug (group hugs work). Also works just holding/ shaking hands if you prefer, but you might want to keep that a secret. 
</div></button>
<button id="Portable-Hole" onclick="Click('Portable-Hole', ['Power-Gem','Epic-Pose','Touchy-Feely','Dial-Up','Other'])" class="unselect"><div>[Portable Hole]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Portable-Hole.PNG"><br>
<div>An Acme-tier hole that you can just plop and adhere onto a flat surface anywhere you like that anyone can walk through and into the Zone. Does not allow light to pass through from the inside to the outside for privacy's sake, so it looks black. 
</div></button>
<button id="Dial-Up" onclick="Click('Dial-Up', ['Power-Gem','Epic-Pose','Touchy-Feely','Portable-Hole','Other'])" class="unselect"><div>[Dial-Up]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Dial-Up.PNG"><br>
<div>Either a phone number to call or text for instant teleport, or a mysterious navigation app that guides users down alleyways that shouldn't exist until they end up in the Zone. What? No, that's definitely not a reference. 
</div></button>
<button id="Other" onclick="Click('Other', ['Power-Gem','Epic-Pose','Touchy-Feely','Portable-Hole','Dial-Up'])" class="unselect"><div>[Other]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Other.PNG"><br>
<div>I'll let you come up with anything you want for this, but you should try to be creative about it. 
</div></button>
</center>

<div class="titleL">Items >>></div>
<div class="titleR">Your Zone would be pretty empty with just furniture, so I have a few options that I think are pretty fucking snazzy. I don't care if you want to turn it into a gun range or an anime-binging pod. As long as you're having fun, I'm happy. You get 15 items. Don't get too attached. There's a few special offers later that cost items. Items can be duped at will. 
</div>

</div></button>
<button id="Gaymen-Piisii" onclick="Item('Gaymen-Piisii', 1)" class="unselect"><div>[Gaymen Piisii]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Gaymen-Piisii.PNG"><br>
<div>A self-upgrading, god-tier gaining rig with a complete collection of PC video games, browsable by any criteria you set. It also possesses ideal versions of all software you care to use (CAD or PS, for example). Perfect peripherals, too. 
</div></button>
<button id="The-Rest" onclick="Item('The-Rest', 1)" class="unselect"><div>[The Rest]</div><br><img src="Pictures/The-Rest.PNG"><br>
<div>A grand, perpetually-updated collection of console video games, said consoles, vidya paraphernalia, all kinds of peripherals, and just about every collector's edition you could ever want. Free TV if you didn't pick the Normiestation.

<div>An unholy combo of everything /fit/ and /sp/ could literally ever want, from workout weights to a gladiatorial blood sports arena. If it's gotta do with exercise, then it'll be here. Free AI players at any skill level you desire when you need them. 
</div></button>
<button id="Fully-Loaded" onclick="Item('Fully-Loaded', 1)" class="unselect"><div>[Fully Loaded]</div><br><img src="Pictures/Fully-Loaded.PNG"><br>
<div>A personal favorite. A truly enormous room filled with guns, containing every single model of gun there is, with extensive aftermarket parts as well. Comes with an indoor range. Infinite ammo, too. No bandanna required.

<div>Tabletop game supplies and anything you need to LARP, in addition to model kits and paints. Most importantly, though, it includes a plethora of fancy and custom dice. You could swim in a pool of dice, if you wanted. Godlike AI GM included. 
</div></button>

</div></button>

<button onclick="Item('out', 2)" class="cardDiv">

<div id="out" style="position: relative; float: right; width: 60%;" class="unselect">>>>/out/(Cost 2 item slots)<br><br>
Some people just need the outdoors to relax, 1 guess. Pick this and the whole dimension has got a whole, whopping 10 thousand square kilometers for you to explore and hang around in (anything you want, remember!). The outdoors here can have up to three "themes," like, "Swiss Alps, Sahara Desert, and Alaskan Ibndra," for example, which you can reseed/change once every couple months (less than a second in real life!). Heck, unlike the last version, you could even have a concrete jungle if you wanted. It doesn't have to be "outdoorsy" anymore. You may also specify what plants and animals should be around (if any at all). <br><br>You can also change things you normally wouldn't think possible, like how fast the day progresses, the color and sun/moon count of the day and night skies, the strength and presence of any aurora, the arrangement of the stars in the sky, and even how long each phase of the day lasts. By all means, you could even make it look like it's a planet orbiting around Jupiter, with the Jovian giant taking up a huge; swathe of the sky. Go crazy. Some part of me always wanted to make a world in permanent darkness, lit; only by a logic-defying eternal supernova remnant or a hyperactive nebulae duster painting the sky an existence-encircling magenta. 
</div>
</button>
<button onclick="Item('friends', 3)" class="cardDiv">
<div class="cardL"><img src="Pictures/friends.PNG" width="100%"></div>
<div id="friends" style="position: relative; float: right; width: 60%;" class="unselect">>>>/friends/(Cost 3 item slots)<br><br>
Loneliness and emptiness have always been my absolute enemies. I see people struggling with no one to cuddle them and say, "I'm here, and I'm not leaving," and it moves me, no matter how many dines I see it. I can't change reality, but I can make the Zone stand strong against it. Of course, you can bring real friends into the Zone, but some of the best, most kindhearted people just don't exist, so that's what this is for. Also good for just chilling or playing around with your favorite fictional characters if you want. <br><br>Some of the options above by necessity have to make some Al-controlled avatars to act as real people. but it's always obvious within a minute of conversation that they're not real. It's very apparent that they're controlled by a simple Al that's only good if you stay on script. By choosing this option, you can summon just about any character under the sun, whether that's your waifu, a humanized abstract concept, a long-dead historical figure, a pet, or just about anyone who'll fit. and you can summon many of them. If you want the full Persona S cast to hang out with you, go right ahead and summon them, and they'll act like they were ripped right from the game. The only accommodations made to personalities is that they won't freak out at their situation of being fictional and they knou enough about you to have a rapport/friendship. You can dispel any character at any time, and characters can put themselves into stasis while you're away from the Zone. They retain no abusable supernatural powers (honor system!). 
</div>
</button>
<button onclick="Item('comfytown', 1)" class="cardDiv">
<div class="cardL"><img src="Pictures/comfytown.PNG" width="100%"></div>
<div id="comfytown" style="position: relative; float: right; width: 60%;" class="unselect">>>>/comfytown/(Cost 1 item slots)<br><br>
If you take both options above, they can he combined in an interesting way. Instead of your Zone being just plopped into the middle of a natural landscape, it'll actually he put as a cool house/mansion/ complex into a neighborhood in a fabricated town or city of your preferred size and description. You can't use this to get unintended items (you can't buy a TV at the local electronics store if you don't have the Normiestation, for example), but the town is filled with tons of random NPCs that all live out highly realistic lives that you can hang out with and become friends with. You might make yourself seem a god to them, or they might not think it weird at all. As always, I like to leave the specifics up to you. <br><br>Speaking of specifics, you can take whatever role you want in here, if you'd like to try being the town's mayor or a local businessman/woman or just a pervy highschool boy in the local school district who likes to invite girls over to his magic mansion so that they can play sexy games with each other using the: powers he bought in the forthcoming section below. You could even totally ignore everyone else in your little slice of heaven and just use them as scenery while you people-watch with your walk) on your I Zone's eternally-twilit porch and look at all the high school students always making mad dashes to class! with their classic toast-in-mouth. 
</div>
</button>

<div class="titleL">Extras >>></div>
<div class="titleR">There are a few more things I can offer you that'll make your time in the Zone better. Or hotter, at any rate. Some are more valuable than others, so they've got point costs. For this section, you've got 17 points to spend. 
</div>

<div>Edit people's forms in the Zone to your liking at any time. Impossible to shift away sentience, so don't worry about that. You can't violate physical laws, but you can get creative. Even... eugh... furry stuff... is possible, if you want.

<button id="Inter-bot-9001" onclick="Point('Inter-bot-9001', 1)" class="unselect"><div>[Inter-bot 9001]<br>(1 Point)</div><br><img src="Pictures/Inter-bot-9001.PNG"><br>

</div></button>
<button id="All-Along" onclick="Point('All-Along', 2)" class="unselect"><div>[All Along]<br>(2 Points)</div><br><img src="Pictures/All-Along.PNG"><br>

All right, anon. I think that's about all I've got for you right now. You can go right ahead and start using your new place any time. When you're tired, scared, or lonely, you can go there, or you can go there when you just want a place to hang out. I do hope you have at least one person to share it with... I think that makes it a million times better, to have someone there with you, y'know? I think so, at least. Maybe you can tell who's waiting for me in mine by some of the images you've seen.. I like to think I made it easy to tell. Anyway, that's it for this one. I'm off to give this to another anon so they can have a place, too. I will try to come back sooner then later, but who really knows how long it'll be? Despite that, the smile on your face tells me you're going to be just fine.
