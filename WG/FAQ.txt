=====================================================================================================================

Q. After the enemy ejaculated, the character became immobile and received serial attacks. Is this a bug?

A. The Pleasure gauge may have been full when you received the ejaculation.
 In that case, you will suffer great damage and cannot rise for some time.
 And other enemies will not leave you alone in that state.

=====================================================================================================================

Q. The player's character does not display.

A. There are some possible causes.
 [Unable to refer to the files]
  Is the "data" folder exists in the "Witch Girl" folder?
  Do files exist in the "data" folder?
  If not, the compressed file may have failed to extract or download correctly. 
  In this case, delete the "Witch Girl" folder. Try redownloading and extracting the product again.
  Also, if you relocate some contents in the "Witch Girl" folder, the game may fail to load. Please take note.

 [Problem with the location]
  The game may fail to load correctly depending on the location of the "Witch Girl" folder.
  Especially, placing it in a location with a long path may prevents it to start normally.
  In this case, try placing the entire "Witch Girl" folder directly under your local disk (e.g. C:).

 [Problem with the browsing environment]
  The game may fail to load correctly when you use the stand-alone player.
  Try starting with a browser (Firefox is recommended) or with software such as Gomplayer.

 If none of the above solves the problem, please contact us with the details of your computer (OS, your browser, version of your flash player).

   Such enemies become viewable in the gallery that will be enhanced after you clear the True mode.
