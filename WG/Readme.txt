    The Pleasure increases while pushing this key.
    If your Pleasure reaches the maximum in this manner, your Bomb count will increase by 1.
    Also, your HP recovers little by little.
    You will suffer great damage if the Pleasure gauge reaches maximum by the attack from the enemy; if you are near the maximum, you should better play with yourself to reach orgasm.

  * Some enemies are resistant to your attacks (magic of fire).
    You may be better evading such enemies.
    Some enemies, conversely, are hard to evade and weak against your attacks.
